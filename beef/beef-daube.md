# Beef Daube - Red Wine Braised

## Ingredients (Serves 3-4)
* 2-3 lbs chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes
* 1/2 bottle (375ml) red wine (Côtes du Rhône or similar)
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* **Optional**: 3 oz thick-cut bacon, diced
* 1 bag TJ's mirepoix (or 1 medium onion, 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks - all diced)
* 2-3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 sprig fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried)
* 1/2 tsp herbes de Provence
* Zest of 1/2 orange (optional)
* Salt and black pepper

## Equipment
* Dutch oven or heavy braising pot
* Combustion thermometer for monitoring

## Method

### Bacon Option
* **With bacon**: Render diced bacon first, brown beef in bacon fat
* **Without bacon**: Use olive oil to brown beef, add extra tablespoon if needed

### Cooking Process
1. **Prep**: Pat beef dry, season with salt and pepper
2. **Brown beef**: Sear cubes in batches (bacon fat or olive oil), don't overcrowd
3. **Build aromatics**: Sauté mirepoix until soft (about 5-7 minutes), add garlic for 1 minute
4. **Deglaze**: Add wine, scrape up brown bits
5. **Assemble**: Return beef (and bacon if using), add herbs, orange zest
6. **Braise**: Cover, cook at 325°F for 2.5-3 hours until fork-tender
7. **Final braise**: Continue cooking until fork-tender (mirepoix cooks with the meat)

## Target Temperatures
* **Oven**: 325°F steady
* **Internal beef**: 190-200°F for fork-tender (use combustion thermometer)
* **Liquid**: Should barely simmer, not boil

## Finishing
* Remove bay leaves and herb stems
* Taste and adjust seasoning
* Optional: Reduce braising liquid on stovetop for richer sauce
* Rest 10 minutes before serving

## Serving Suggestions
* Over egg noodles, pappardelle, or polenta
* Crusty French bread for sopping sauce
* Simple green salad
* Pairs perfectly with remaining red wine

## Cook Log

### September 1, 2025
* 3 lbs chuck roast, cubed
* Made own mirepoix (TJ's precut wasn't available), fresh thyme, 3 bay leaves
* 1 cup red wine + 1 box beef broth for braising liquid
* Seared in beef tallow - really good results
* **Result**: Great! Perfect tender texture
* **Notes**: Salted meat after removing from red wine marinade, but wasn't salted enough
* **Lesson**: Need to salt meat more generously before searing for better flavor

### Notes
* Perfect winter dish to complement your BBQ repertoire
* Half bottle of wine leaves plenty for drinking while cooking
* Freezes well for future meals
* Without bacon, let the wine and beef flavors shine
