# Hanger Steak

## Cut Selection
* Prime grade from butcher
* ~0.8 lb steak

## Rub Recipe
* Use tri-tip rub recipe (scaled for smaller cut):
  * 1/2 tbsp kosher salt
  * 3/4 tsp garlic powder
  * Pinch dried parsley (crushed in hand)
  * 1/2 tsp shroomami powder

## Method
* Reverse sear with two-zone cooking
* Light grill 10-15 minutes before cooking
* Low and slow to **130°F internal** (not higher)
* Quick high-heat sear for crust only - **don't try to raise temp during sear**
* Much shorter sear time than tri-tip due to smaller size

## Target Temperatures
* **Slow cook phase**: 130°F internal
* **After sear**: 130-132°F (sear for crust, not temperature)
* **Final rest**: Will rise to ~135°F

## Cook Notes

### Aug 18, 2025 - Prime Cut
* 0.8 lb prime hanger from butcher
* Used tri-tip rub - **excellent flavor**
* **Timing**: ~45 minutes total cook time
* Slow cooked to 128°F, seared until SafeCook (130°F)
* **Problem**: Final temp hit 140-144°F = overcooked
* **Result**: Center was perfect, edges overdone
* **Lesson**: Stop searing once good crust forms, don't chase temperature

**Key Points**:
* Hanger steak cooks much faster than tri-tip
* Target 130°F max for slow phase
* Sear for crust only, not temperature
* Tri-tip rub works perfectly on hanger
