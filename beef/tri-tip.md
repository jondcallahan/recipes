# Tri Tip

## Rub Recipe (2.5 lb roast)
* 1 tbsp kosher salt
* 1.5 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp dried parsley (crushed in hand)
* 1 tsp shroomami powder

*Adapted from [Trevor's Virtual Weber Bullet recipe](https://www.virtualweberbullet.com/tri-tip-low-slow/)*

## Method
* Slow cook to 110-120°F internal
* Then sear to finish
* **Don't overcook**: Taking to 130°F = overdone

## Wood
* Just one handful of chips at start
* More than that = too smoky
