# Chicken Breast

## Reverse Sear Method

### August 3, 2025
* Seasoned with kosher salt, black pepper, and garlic powder 15 minutes before (salted in fridge while lighting grill)
* Put on grill at 5:30pm on cool side of weber kettle with slow and sear insert
* Target: 225-250°F until internal temp hits 153°F
* Combustion set to 153°F (SafeCook starts at 135°F but prefer higher temp for better texture)
* Then sear on hot side 2-3 minutes per side to 158°F - carry over took it up to ~160º
* Rested 5 minutes before slicing and serving

**Results:** Delicious! Reverse sear method worked perfectly for juicy chicken breast.

### August 10, 2025
* Used same recipe as August 3rd
* Added wood chips to the coals
* Same reverse sear method

**Results:** Not good. Wood chips made it too smoky with bad flavor. Would NOT recommend adding wood chips to chicken breast.
