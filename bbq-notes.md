# Barbecue BBQ Notes
## Pork belly
### Bacon
#### 7/16/22
* Meat from Porter road, 3.14 pounds belly skin off
* Used amazing ribs recipe plus maple syrup for 5 days, flipping every day
* Had grill at 200-220 for a few hours until meat hit 150Â°
* Decent handful of oak chips at start
* Another decent handful at T+25 mins
* Result: a bit too much smoke flavor
* Super rich. Good maple flavor
**Jul 20, 2024**
* Meat from Wildfork, 4.18 pounds aged Berkshire pork belly
* Looked for amazing ribs recipe again but the site was pulled down
* Used [nitrite curing calculator](https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/nitritecuringcalculator.html) to find the amount of Prague powder number 1 to use
* Used 2 cups distiled water and 6g of PP1
* Adapted recipe from [Postal BBQ Bacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHOwK6u2Qdg) with help of [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/chat/29813799-874c-482d-ab2a-e6b72578ef14)

## Pork butt
* Cross hatch score the fat cap
* Yellow mustard, then rub
* Put on grill fat side up
* Start spritzing after 3 hours, every half hour
  * Equal parts apple juice and ACV, splash of hot sauce and worchestire
* Franklin goes for 275Âº, and wraps it when the bark splits, spritz it a lot before wrapping
* Let it rest for 30mins to an hour, longer better

### August 15, 2020
* Followed the above with temps around 275Â° for the first three hours, the meat temperature was coming up quickly so I backed it off to 250Â° but then that was too slow so I brought it up to 300Â° and finished on time. 
* Meat was on the grill from 9:30-6 for 7.5 pounds
* Wrapped in butcher paper at 154Â° and kept it wrapped until 203Â°
* Rested for a touch over an hour still wrapped
* Turned out incredible. Best yet ðŸ˜‹ 

### Oct 10, 2022
* Did not salt overnight like Meatheadâ€™s recipe calls for so I salted for 1 hour in fridge at 1/2 tsp per pound
* Doing two at once so roughly 12-13 pounds and 6-7 tsp of kosher salt
* Rested for 1 hour after salting
* Covered generously in Memphis dust rub
* Tied up in butchers twine
* Put on 280Âº grill, added a medium handful of House oak wood chips

## Ribs 
* 1.5-2 tsp salt for 2.5lbs meat 24 hours before
  * Ribs came out hammy. Use less salt or same amount of salt for less time 
* Same salt level as before for 2 hours for thinner ribs turned out good
* Rubbed small amount of mustard on before adding rub, then used a mustard and ACV based sauce - have it a really nice apple and mustard fall flavor. Could use a bit more Memphis dust since the acidity cut down the sweetness
* Did 3 hours at ~250Â° average and they could have used a bit more time
* Used sauce and set instead of sauce and sear and it was good. Do that in the future
* Put a lot of salt on with no time to rest, straight on the smoker and they cane out very dry. Go with light salt if theyâ€™re going straight on. 
* ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 2020: Removed membrane then did 1.5-2 tsp salt per pound 2 hours before, then 3 hours smoke, 2 hours wrapped, 1 hour sauce and set, came out dry
* Try half the amount of salt and 2-3-.5 smoke, wrapped, sauce and set
* 7/25/20: did just over 2 tsp salt for 3ish pounds 2 hrs before
  * 2 small handfuls of wood chips at start
  * 2 more small handfuls at T+30 and an apple juice spritz
  * T+1:20 Apple juice spritz
  * T+1:50 spritz
  * T+2:45 wrapped meat side down in foil with apple juice, bumped heat from 225 to 250
  * Best yet
* 6/18/21: using St. Louis cut from costco
  * 2 ish tbsp (oops!) salt 1 hour before
  * Rubbed with yellow mustard after an hour and used 2 tbsp of Memphis dust per side of the whole rack
  * 225Â° with wood to start
  * T+:30 more wood and a spritz 
  * 1 hr another spritz. Gonna try and keep them moist since I over salted
* 7/18/21: St. Louis spare ribs from Costco, temps 210Â°-235Â°
  * 1/2 tsp salt on each side of a half slab 90 minutes before
  * Rubbed with olive oil
  * 1-1.5 tbsp of rub per side per half slab
  * 4 hours unwrapped with wood chips every 20 minutes, no spritzing
  * 1 hour wrapped with 50/50 apple juice and ACV
  * 30 minutes unwrapped
  * 1 layer of sauce on top
  * 30 more minutes

Turned out really freaking good. Perfect texture but could use more flavor. Try more rub and painting with sauce twice.  Try more chips to get a better smoke ring. 
* 5/22/22: St Louis spare ribs from Costco (frozen, thawed, frozen, thawed again ðŸ˜¬), temps steady at mostly 225Âº
  * 1/2 tsp salt on tops only 2.5 hours before
  * Rubbed with olive oil
  * Scant tbsp of rub per side per half slab
  * 3.25 hours unwrapped with wood chips at 1 hour and 1.5 hours
  * 3(!!) hours wrapped with a little bit of apple juice
  * 30 mins unwrapped

Turned out braised (too fall off the bone for me and braised meat texture) and not very flavorful. Be sure to:
1. Salt both sides
2. Use nearly 1.5 tbsp of rub per side if using olive oil
3. Spritz it while cooking
4. Only wrap for 1-2 hours
5. Sauce it at the end
* Jun 24, 2023
* Making three slabs Saturday to save two for next weekend so using the rib rack for 6 half slabs
* Salted just over 1/2 teaspoon per side on the meat side and just under on the bone side 1 hour before, maybe a bit less
* 1 tsp per side of Memphis dust
* Put them all on at 225Â° in the rib rack and added some wood
* Didnâ€™t use a binder, just used the water that the salt drew out to rub in with the rub

## Brisket
* Get 15 pounds or less
* Buy a choice or prime
* Cut the fat cap down to about 1/4 inch
* Wrap it after an hour of stall for prime since it has more fat therefore moisture and will steam itself if wrapped right at the time it stalls
* Might take 24 hours
* Put the seam of the butcher paper on the bottom

* Woke up at 6am to start trimming, followed [BBQ With Franklin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTzdMHu5KU) video
* Used a rub of equal parts Coarse Kosher S+P
  * Sprinkled some garlic powder and ground cumin after covering it with S+P
* Whole brisket started at 12 pounds, probably 10.5 after trimming
* Put on at 7:45am at 240Âº - after putting on wood chips the temp got up to 255 but I left the vents as is to let the temp drift back down after the wood chips stopped flaring
* Following the [Baby Back Maniac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCP_ZPhuR9I) video for 1/2 low and slow, 1/2 hot and fast to finish, wrapped in butcher paper
* Check bark for doneness with scratch test at noon
* Start checking the temp and probing it at 200Âº - usually 2 hours after wrapping
* When the probe feels like itâ€™s going through *cold* butter thatâ€™s when itâ€™s done and ready to rest
* Rest in a faux cambro for 2-4 hours, burping cooler every 15 mins
* 12:15 - wrapped in two sheets of butcher paper after cooking mostly at the high end of 225-255, now bumping to 300

**Rub**
* 1 tbsp kosher salt

* 1/4 tsp dried parsley crushed in hand to be smaller
* 1 tsp shroomami powder

Adapted from [Trevorâ€™s recipe](https://www.virtualweberbullet.com/tri-tip-low-slow/)

* Slow cook up to 110-120Âº, then sear
  * Tried taking it up to 130Âº and it was over done
* just do one handful of wood chips at the start otherwise it gets too smoky
* Used that rub recipe for a 2.5 lb usda prime from wild fork (defrosted in sous vide for 2 hrs)
  * Turned out great
