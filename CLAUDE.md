## Cooking Tools
- I use a combustion predictive thermometer to measure doneness with their SafeCook feature

## Cooking Techniques
- I like to cook reverse sear style with low and slow first then sear to finish
- I use a slow and sear insert in my weber kettle so always use two zone cooking
- I like to light my grill 10-15 minutes before putting meat on
