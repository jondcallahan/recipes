## Cooking Tools
- I use a combustion predictive thermometer to measure doneness with their SafeCook feature

## Cooking Techniques
- I like to cook reverse sear style with low and slow first then sear to finish
- I use a slow and sear insert in my weber kettle so always use two zone cooking
- I like to light my grill 10-15 minutes before putting meat on

## Recipe Organization
- Organize recipes by protein type in folders (beef/, pork/, chicken/, etc.)
- Include rubs/ and sauces/ folders for accompaniments
- Use descriptive filenames like pork-chops.md, sausages.md

## Cook Log Format
- Add cook log sections to recipe files with specific dates
- Use format: ### Month DD, YYYY
- Include key observations, timing, and results for each cook
