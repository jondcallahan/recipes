# Coppa Steaks (Pork Neck/Money Muscle)

**Cut**: 1.5-2 inch thick steaks from coppa roast
**Method**: Reverse sear - low & slow then high heat finish (recommended for 1.5"+ thickness)

## Rub
* 1 tsp kosher salt per steak (30-60 mins before)
* 1/2 tsp coarse black pepper
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* Pinch of paprika

## Two-Zone Setup
* Slow 'N Sear insert with coals on one side
* Target temp: 225-250°F indirect side
* Oak chips - small handful at start

## Method
1. **Low & Slow Phase**
   * Place steaks on indirect side
   * Cook to 125-130°F internal (use Combustion SafeCook)
   * About 45-60 minutes depending on thickness
   * Optional: light spritz with apple juice/ACV at 30 mins

2. **Sear Phase**
   * Move steaks directly over coals
   * Sear 2-3 minutes per side
   * Target final temp: 140-145°F internal
   * Let Combustion SafeCook guide final temp

## Rest & Serve
* Rest 5-10 minutes
* Slice against the grain
* Finish with flake salt

## Alternative Methods

### Hot & Fast Direct Grilling (for thinner cuts <1")
* 8-10 minutes total, flipping every 2 minutes
* Direct over coals to 135-140°F internal
* "St. Louis style": rub + grill to 160°F with sauce glaze

### Low & Slow Smoking (country ribs style)
* 225°F for 5-6 hours to 190-195°F
* Wrap in foil with butter/brown sugar when tender
* Maximum breakdown of connective tissue

### Sous Vide + Sear
* 135°F for 12 hours, then sear on grill
* Ultimate precision method

**Notes**: 
* Coppa has great marbling - won't dry out like lean chops
* Thickness determines method: 1.5"+ = reverse sear, <1" = hot & fast
* Can push to 160°F if you prefer well-done
* Great with board sauce or simple finishing salt
