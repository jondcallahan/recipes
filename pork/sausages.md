# Sausages - Low and Slow

## Technique
- Low and slow on indirect heat, then sear to finish
- Cook to 160°F internal temperature
- Same method used for bratwurst and hot dogs

## Cook Setup
- Two zone cooking with Slow and Sear insert in Weber kettle
- Light grill 10-15 minutes before cooking
- Place on indirect side alongside other proteins

## Notes
- Timing works well with 1.5" pork chops - both finish around the same time
- Sausages cook faster due to smaller diameter but need higher temp (160°F vs 140°F for pork chops)
- These factors balance out for similar cook times
