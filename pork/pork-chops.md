## Mediterranean Brine Variation to Try (Autre Monde Inspired)
*Inspired by: https://www.oakpark.com/2025/08/19/autre-monde-pork-chop/*

**Brine for 4 cups water:**
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons black peppercorns
- 1 tablespoon pink peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds (lightly crushed)
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 3 garlic cloves

**Process:**
- Dissolve salt and sugar in warm water, add spices
- Cool completely before adding chops
- Brine 2-3 hours (max 4 hours)
- Pat dry before cooking with reverse sear method
- Rest 5-10 minutes after searing (key step from restaurant)
- Serve with caramelized fennel and olives

## Seasoning Comparison
- **Maverick Rub**: Better flavor overall but needs additional salt
- **Salt and Pepper**: Well-salted, good baseline flavor

## Notes
- Consider adding more salt to Maverick rub or light salt application before rub
- Timing works well with sausages cooked using same method
