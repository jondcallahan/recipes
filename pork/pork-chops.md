# Pork Chops - Reverse Sear

## Technique
- Reverse sear method: low and slow on indirect heat first, then sear to finish
- Cook to 140Â°F internal temperature before searing
- Use combustion predictive thermometer with SafeCook feature

## Cook Setup
- Two zone cooking with Slow and Sear insert in Weber kettle
- Light grill 10-15 minutes before cooking
- 1.5 inch thick pork chops

## Seasoning Comparison
- **Maverick Rub**: Better flavor overall but needs additional salt
- **Salt and Pepper**: Well-salted, good baseline flavor

## Notes
- Consider adding more salt to Maverick rub or light salt application before rub
- Timing works well with sausages cooked using same method
