# Pork Ribs (St. Louis Cut)

## Basic Method (Best Results - 7/18/21)
* 1/2 tsp salt each side, 90 minutes before
* Rub with olive oil
* 1-1.5 tbsp rub per side per half slab
* 4 hours unwrapped (210-235Â°F) with wood every 20 mins
* 1 hour wrapped with 50/50 apple juice/ACV
* 30 minutes unwrapped with sauce
* 30 more minutes

## Salt Timing Guide
* **2.5 lbs meat**: 1.5-2 tsp salt, 24 hours before (came out hammy - too much)
* **Thinner ribs**: Same salt, 2 hours before (turned out good)
* **3+ lbs**: 2+ tsp salt, 2 hours before

## Temperature & Timing
* **Target temp**: 225Â°F (210-235Â°F range)
* **Wood schedule**: Every 20-30 minutes for first 2-3 hours
* **Wrap timing**: After 3-4 hours when bark is set
* **Wrap duration**: 1-2 hours max (3 hours = too braised)

## Spritz Recipe
* 50/50 apple juice and ACV
* Optional: splash hot sauce

## Cook Notes

### Early Experiments (Undated)
* **Hammy ribs**: 1.5-2 tsp salt for 2.5 lbs, 24 hours before - came out hammy
* **Timing fix**: Same salt level, 2 hours for thinner ribs - turned out good
* **Mustard technique**: Small amount mustard binder + mustard/ACV sauce gave nice apple and mustard fall flavor, but acidity cut sweetness - need more Memphis dust
* **Timing lesson**: 3 hours at ~250Â°F average, could have used more time
* **Sauce technique**: "Sauce and set" instead of "sauce and sear" was good - do this in future
* **Salt timing**: Lot of salt with no rest, straight on smoker = very dry. Use light salt if going straight on

### ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 2020 (July 4th)
* Removed membrane, 1.5-2 tsp salt per pound, 2 hours before
* 3 hours smoke, 2 hours wrapped, 1 hour sauce and set
* **Result**: Came out dry
* **Plan**: Try half salt amount, 2-3 hours smoke, wrap, sauce and set

### 7/25/20 - Great Results
* 2+ tsp salt for 3 lbs, 2 hours before
* 2 small handfuls wood at start
* 2 more at T+30 with apple juice spritz
* Spritzing at T+1:20 and T+1:50
* Wrapped at T+2:45 with apple juice, bumped to 250Â°F
* **Result**: Best yet

### 6/18/21 - Over-Salted Learning
* St. Louis cut from Costco
* 2 ish tbsp salt (oops!), 1 hour before  
* Yellow mustard binder + 2 tbsp Memphis dust per side of whole rack
* 225Â°F with wood to start
* T+30: more wood and spritz
* T+1hr: another spritz (trying to keep moist since over-salted)

### 7/18/21 - Perfect Method
* St. Louis from Costco, 210-235Â°F
* 1/2 tsp salt each side, 90 mins before
* Olive oil binder, 1-1.5 tbsp rub per side
* 4 hours unwrapped, wood every 20 mins, no spritzing
* 1 hour wrapped with apple juice/ACV
* 30 mins unwrapped + sauce, 30 more mins
* **Result**: Really freaking good texture, need more flavor
* **Next time**: More rub, paint sauce twice, more chips for smoke ring

### 5/22/22 - Lessons Learned
* Frozen/thawed/frozen/thawed ribs (not ideal)
* Only salted tops, 2.5 hours before
* 3.25 hours unwrapped, 3 hours wrapped (too long!)
* **Result**: Braised texture, not flavorful

### Jun 24, 2023 - Rib Rack Method
* Three slabs for saving, using rib rack for 6 half slabs
* Just over 1/2 tsp salt per side (meat side), just under on bone side
* 1 hour before cooking
* 1 tsp Memphis dust per side
* 225Â°F with wood, no binder - used salt-drawn water to work in rub

## Key Takeaways
1. Salt both sides, not just tops
2. Use 1.5 tbsp rub per side with oil binder
3. Spritz while cooking for moisture
4. Only wrap 1-2 hours max
5. Sauce at the end
6. Wood chips every 20-30 mins for smoke ring
